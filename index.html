    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
    <p>
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach technical sophistication, the seemingly
        magical ability to take command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes everything from
        command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages, and knowing when to just
        reboot the darn thing. We believe there are <strong><em>at least a billion people</em></strong> who can benefit
        from learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our movement, <a

        HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Tim Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

    <p>
        When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

        You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
